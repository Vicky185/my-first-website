# My very first Web Page

Welcome!

In this project I have created a web page using HTML5 and CSS. 
The web page is called Stream One (aka index.html) and you have links to two other pages: Stream Two and Stream Three. 

### Stream One

In Stream One I have used HTML5 to input six different images of different types of programming languages. 
Each image has a title which also consists a link to an externally linked website (wikipedia).

### Stream Two and Three

In both Stream Two and Three, we have the same as Stream One but different sets of images and programming languages each with their subsequent names linked to external websites for further information.

### Technologies used

* HTML5
* CSS
* Git
* Cloud9
* GitHub

#### HTML5

In each of the streams in the web page, we used **cards** to make space for images and **links** to respective websites for ifferent programming languages. 

In Stream One we have:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Cloud9
* Git
* GitHub

In Stream Two we have:
* Python
* Flask
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* GitHub
* Git

In Stream Three we have:
* Python
* Django
* Hiroku
* GitHub
* Git
* MySQL

#### CSS

In our CSS usage, we created the style for each of the **cards** and titles for **links**. 
I also styled the presentation of the web page, ensuring that the colour of the border of the page was a certain colour and that if the cursor scrolls over the other pages then it changes to white background. 

### Rationale for project

To test combination of HTML5 and CSS, creating a web page and navigation in it. Also testing use of console and familiarisation with Git and GitHub.

## Hope you enjoy!
